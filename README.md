-Target user profile: 

This curriculum is aimed on those companies looking for programmers, especially focused on the html and css language, as can be seen on the website.

-Information architecture:

The architecture of the web page it is divided into each section of the page. The left side, the right side, the top, the bot, each section organized to make it easier to read and understand.

-Visual design:

In the visual design I wanted to arrange the information in the easiest way for the public to read and understand. Sorting each section and calculating each size so that everything is perfectly placed.
Regarding the colors, I have chosen some dark colors to maintain the formality, along with a bright color (yellow) to highlight the important things in the curriculum
